Kyphosis is a spinal disorder in which an excessive outward curve of the spine results in an abnormal rounding of the upper back. We use *Decison Tree and Random Forests* to predict  if after a corrective surgery the patient will still be having Kyphosis or not depending on factors such as age,number of vertabrae involved in the operation and number of the first (top most) vertabrae operated on.  
### LendingClub-project

Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.
