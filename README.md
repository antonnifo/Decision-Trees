Kyphosis is a spinal disorder in which an excessive outward curve of the spine results in an abnormal rounding of the upper back. We use *Decison Tree and Random Forests* to predict  if after a corrective surgery the patient will still be having Kyphosis or not depending on factors such as age,number of vertabrae involved in the operation and number of the first (top most) vertabrae operated on.
